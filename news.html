    <p>TIM BERNERS LEE created the world wide web in 1989. But the idea of hypertext stretches back much further. If you read about the history of computing and the Internet, you'll surely read about Vannevar Bush's Memex concept, Douglas Engelbart's Mother of All Demos, Ted Nelson's Xanadu, and maybe even H.G. Wells's World Brain. If you've never explored this history, you can check out last week's Tech Time Warp, the BBC's 1990 documentary Hyperland.
